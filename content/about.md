Wrath & Ruin Brewing Company is located midway between Leeds and York, in a village called Sherburn in Elmet.

With a focus on providing innovative craft beer to our customers, we source ingredients locally and ethically to create taste sensations.

We are a part time nano-brewery, with big ambitions!

* **Local** - As many of our ingredients as possible will be locally sourced – Our Malt is from Thomas Fawcett in Castleford and we are currently building relationships with local farms to source, strawberries, rhubarb, raspberries and gooseberries amongst other things.

* **Ethical** - Where our ingredients cannot be sourced locally, they will be from ethical suppliers that are both fair trade and sustainable. Everyone will get a fair deal from us.

* **Vegetarian/Vegan** - As so called ‘flexitarians’, we will not use any animal based finings; all of our beers will be unfined, unfiltered and vegetarian friendly. The majority of our beers will be also suitable for vegans.

* **Green** - All of our equipment is low wattage and power is provided from 100% renewable sources. Our waste products will be kept to a minimum; spent grain will go to feed chickens kept by friends and family. Waste water will be used for cleaning or when suitable stored for use on our plants.
