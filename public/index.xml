      <description>Wrath &amp;amp; Ruin Brewing Company is located midway between Leeds and York, in a village called Sherburn in Elmet.
With a focus on providing innovative craft beer to our customers, we source ingredients locally and ethically to create taste sensations.
We are a part time nano-brewery, with big ambitions!
 Local - As many of our ingredients as possible will be locally sourced – Our Malt is from Thomas Fawcett in Castleford and we are currently building relationships with local farms to source, strawberries, rhubarb, raspberries and gooseberries amongst other things.</description>

      <description>Simon Head Brewer  Simon had to endure being harassed by Mark to try craft beer and eventually caved and tried an IPA. This was the start of a journey, which has seen him get a handle on many different styles of beer – especially Belgian styles on many trips there. Starting home brewing a few years ago Simon quickly found himself in his element and knew this is what he wanted to do for a living.</description>
